# QA inventory

## User-visible claims

1. Every theme folder scanned from `themes/` and `themes-private/` is available at runtime; `node scripts/injector.mjs --themes` lists them with the resolved default theme/layout.
2. Every theme supports two persisted home layouts: top banner and fullscreen canvas.
3. The real Codex suggestion buttons occupy the visual middle and the real project selector/composer stays at the bottom in both layouts.
4. Normal tasks use a separate, faint, subject-focused chat-art layer with a light wash; message text remains dominant.
5. The sidebar is warm glass rather than merely changing the accent color.
6. All real Codex controls remain interactive; the skin is not a screenshot overlay and has no on-screen switch UI of its own (switching is programmatic via `scripts/set-theme.mjs`).
7. The skin survives route changes and renderer reloads while the injector daemon runs.
8. The official Store package and `app.asar` remain unchanged.
9. Restore removes the injected DOM/CSS and install/restore can be repeated.

## Functional checks

- Home feature card: click one card and confirm the real composer is populated or the normal action occurs.
- Project selector: click the real project chip under the "选择项目" label and confirm the native project menu opens.
- Sidebar: open a real task, then return to New Task.
- Composer: type text, verify caret/readability, then clear it without sending.
- Theme switch: `node scripts/set-theme.mjs <name> [layout]` for each scanned theme; confirm the header copy, accents, home art, and chat art all update, the command's `persisted` output matches, and the final choice survives reload.
- Layout switch: switch between `banner` and `fullscreen`; confirm the native suggestion buttons remain centered and the native composer remains bottom-aligned; confirm the final choice survives reload.
- Chat route: open a real task in every theme and confirm the full chat-art layer appears only behind the task, not on the home screen.
- Reload: use CDP `Page.reload`, wait, and confirm the injection marker returns.
- Normal restart persistence: close all Codex processes, launch it normally without debug arguments, and confirm the platform watcher relaunches it on port 9335 with the saved theme/layout restored.
- Closed-app behavior: leave Codex closed for at least two watcher polls and confirm the watcher remains idle instead of launching the app.
- Desktop pet: confirm the `initialRoute=/avatar-overlay` renderer has no Dream Skin class, style, chrome, or state and its computed body background is transparent; reload that renderer and confirm it stays clean.
- Restore/reapply cycle: remove live skin, verify marker absent (no `codex-dream-skin`/`dream-theme-*`/`dream-layout-*` classes, no injected nodes, no state object, no inline `--dream-*` vars, no `.dream-new-task` marker, composer placeholder back to the native text), apply again, verify marker present.
- Hit testing: `document.elementsFromPoint` at the center of the sidebar new-task button, the profile button, every suggestion card, the composer input, and the send button must resolve to the real control (or a descendant), with the chrome layer and every sticker computed as `pointer-events: none`.
- Card subtitles: themes with `cards.subtitles` show them under the native card titles; narrowing the window so the native grid drops to 3 and 2 cards must drop the matching subtitles with no misalignment; themes without the field show no subtitle.
- Stickers: only themes with a `stickers` field show them, fullscreen home only (never banner, never chat), never overlapping a native control; public demo themes ship without stickers and README screenshots must not contain personal promo text.
- Themed placeholder: only themes with `composer.placeholder` change the home composer placeholder; the chat/task composer keeps its native placeholder in every theme.
- Theme validation: a theme with a missing required token, a bad folder name, or an unscoped `extra.css` must be skipped/rejected with a `[dream-skin]` warning on stderr and must not break the remaining themes.
- Update resilience: Windows resolves the current `OpenAI.Codex` Appx location dynamically; macOS discovers `ChatGPT.app` / `Codex.app` and reads `CFBundleExecutable` from `Info.plist`. Never store a versioned executable path.
- macOS lifecycle: launch the app bundle through LaunchServices and confirm it remains alive after the invoking shell exits; do not execute `Contents/MacOS/ChatGPT` directly.
- macOS screenshot: `verify-dream-skin.sh --screenshot <path>` captures the Codex window itself by Quartz window ID even when another app overlaps it; it must not use CDP `Page.captureScreenshot`.
- macOS simple install: with `PATH` restricted to system utilities and no external `node`, `autoskin-macos.sh install --no-start --no-auto-recover` uses the official app's bundled Node.js, applies the base theme, creates the backup, and does not install a LaunchAgent.
- macOS stable install: after installation, move the source checkout and confirm the installed runtime can still start, verify, switch themes, auto-recover, and uninstall. Reinstalling atomically refreshes the runtime without leaving the old watcher/injector alive.
- macOS remembered defaults: install with a non-default port and app path, then run `start`, `theme`, `verify`, `doctor`, and `uninstall` without repeating them; each command must use `install-state.json`. Full uninstall must succeed repeatedly even when no base-color backup remains.
- macOS quick-theme: generate one light and one dark route from PNG/JPG fixtures, confirm exactly 28 tokens and valid injector discovery, repeat generation safely, reject a built-in/manual name collision, refresh the stable runtime, and confirm private themes survive. When CDP is active, reload without restarting Codex and apply the requested layout.
- macOS Finder entry points: the install, image-to-theme, and uninstall `.command` files are executable, resolve paths relative to themselves, surface failures without closing immediately, use a native file chooser for theme art, and require confirmation before restarting or uninstalling.

## Visual checks

- 1280x820 initial home: in both layouts, hero, native cards, real project selector, and composer are all visible without horizontal scrolling or header overlap.
- First-entry density: the hero anchors the top/canvas, suggestions occupy the middle, and the real project selector/composer stays at the bottom; reject a large accidental empty band or collisions.
- Swappable art: changing a theme's home or chat image may require only that theme's crop/wash tokens in its `theme.json`; hero/card/composer geometry must not depend on a specific subject position.
- Ghost-text ban: zoom into every corner of both layouts; no readable text, UI fragments, or border lines from the source art may remain. Prefer a heavier overlay over any ghosting (see THEME-SPEC.md §5).
- Chat readability: the subject may be recognizable, but fake source text/cards and high-contrast detail must not compete with real messages.
- Narrower window: accept Codex's native responsive behavior; no essential control is covered and the polaroid intentionally hides at 1400px and below.
- Normal task: messages remain readable and composer does not overlap content.
- Inspect the sidebar, header, hero edges, card labels, composer controls, scrollbar, ribbon, and bottom-right decoration.
- Reject black/transparent sidebar artifacts, clipped cards, duplicated/disconnected project labels, rasterized native controls, deep chat fills, readable fake controls from source art, weak contrast, or decorations intercepting clicks.
- Reject any colored square, gradient, or opaque panel behind a desktop pet. Auxiliary overlay windows must remain transparent even while the main window is fully skinned.

## Exploratory checks

- Start when the debug port is occupied: fail with a clear message or use a caller-selected port.
- Start after Codex updates: package discovery and injection still work without patching installed files.
- Start with zero valid themes: the injector must fail with a clear "No valid themes found" error instead of injecting a broken payload.
